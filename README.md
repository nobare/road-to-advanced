C is general-purpose imperative programming language that suports structured programming
Writing C program steps:
    1 - Define the program objectives
        -> Understand the requirements of the program
        -> Get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish
    2 - Design the  program
        -> Decide how the program will meet the requirements
        -> What should the user interface be like?
        -> How should the program be organized?
    3 - Write the code
        -> Define language and dependencies
    4 - Compile
        -> Translate the source code into machine code (executable code)
        -> Detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in numeric code
    5 - Run the program
    6 - Test and debug the program
    7 - Maintain and modify the program

Preprocessor directive ( # )
    Example :
        -> #include <stdio> (standard input/output)
